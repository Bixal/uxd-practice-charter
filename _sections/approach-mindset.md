### The golden circle

What is the why, how, and what of the UX Design practice?

-   **Why we do what we do**: We envision a world where everybody who uses the products and services we create or improve gets what they need and enjoys doing it.
-   **How we do it**: We take a human-centered approach to design. That means we seek to deeply understand the people we’re designing for by talking to them and observing what they do and keeping them at the center of the creation process.
-   **What we do**: We apply the practices of UX design (including research, interpretation, ideation, prototyping, etc.) alongside our teammates and stakeholders to co-create useful, usable, and delightful experiences.

### The hierarchy of UX needs

This is a slight variation on Aarron Walter’s “hierarchy of needs of users.” When considering what people need, there is a priority, beginning with a foundation of usefulness. But any solution should include aspects of all three components.

-   **Useful**: the foundation. We’re creating something to fulfill some purpose. If it’s not meeting a human need, it doesn’t matter how well it works or how nice it looks.
-   **Usable**: the table stakes. It has to work as expected and be as inclusive as possible for people of varying degrees of experience and abilities.
-   **Delightful**: the icing. We want to help people get things done, but we also want them to enjoy doing it. Even filling out a form can be pleasantly surprising if you put the extra effort into it.

### The experience design landscape

Where does UX fit in among HCD, CX, and Service Design?  

In [_User Experience vs. Customer Experience: What’s The Difference?_](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-vs-cx/), Kim Salazar of NN Group discusses scopes of experience at three levels: interaction, journey, and relationship. These roughly map to UX, HCD, and CX.

Because Service Design incorporates the design of the organization itself (people, processes, and props), and how it supports the overall customer journey, it is present at all levels, but in varying degrees.

The UX Design Team primarily operates at the interaction and journey levels. We are usually focused on a particular channel (e.g., a website) or a piece of that channel, but we’re also considering the context of the end-to-end journey of the customer: What did they do before this interaction? What will they do next? And what is their motivation?

### Human-centeredness vs. other approaches

What does it mean to have a human-centered mindset?  

To understand the HCD mindset, it helps to consider the alternatives. If you’re doing organization-driven design, the priorities come from the top down. They typically define the technology constraints and the humans and their needs are an afterthought.

With an HCD approach, you start with the human needs, and you keep them central throughout the process as you factor in organizational priorities and technological constraints. This roughly maps to the IDEO concept of Design Thinking that balances viability, feasibility, and desirability.

Referring back to the levels of experience (interaction, journey, relationship), HCD is less an applied practice than a mindset that must be fostered throughout the whole organization and individual projects. It involves multiple disciplines on the project team (not just designers) and multiple departments within the organization. You can try to do UX Design without an HCD approach (which is a situation we sometimes find ourselves in), but the results are usually less-than-satisfactory.
