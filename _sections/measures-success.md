This is not something we currently do in any formalized way. These are two approaches we might implement moving forward, though one is more feasible than the other.

### The outcomes model

If we truly want to measure outcomes, we can return to the conceptual frameworks described above for the UX Hierarchy of Needs at the interaction level and the HCD Mindset at the journey level.  

For each level, we could evaluate our solution against the criteria and make a determination about our degree of success on a given project. **_This would be ideal, but this approach is very difficult, if not impossible, with the way our projects are currently procured, staffed, and delivered._**  

Interaction level:

-  Is it useful?
-  Is it usable?
-  Is it desirable?  


Journey level:

-  Is it desirable?
-  Is it feasible?
-  Is it viable?

### The outputs model

A more practical approach would be to measure and evaluate our actual activities as a proxy for success, with the idea that assuming we are able to do these types of things, it should result in positive outcomes (though itâ€™s certainly not a guarantee.)  

This is only a start, but the criteria could look something like this:

-  **Research planning**: was the research plan appropriate for the project and the initial questions?
-  **Research iteration**: was there more than 1 round of research completed?
-  **Research execution**: were we able to complete all the planned activities?
-  **Findings**: were we able to share findings and get actionable feedback from key stakeholders?
-  **Design iteration**: did we explore more than one approach?
-  **Formative testing**: did we test designs in progress and incorporate feedback into subsequent explorations?
-  **Implementation**: were we able to work with Development on acceptable workarounds that still achieved the design intent?
-  **Validation**: were we able to get feedback on the live, implemented design?
