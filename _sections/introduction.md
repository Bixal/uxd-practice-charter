The purpose of this charter is to define the practice of User Experience (UX) Design, as it exists today at Bixal. The content is based on a number of discussions and workshop sessions over the past year, including the most recent practice area charter activity in June 2020.  

The charter contains the following sections:

- [**Approach & mindset**](#approach-and-mindset): The why. Before we jump into activities and outputs, we set the stage for what the UX Design practice is all about and how it relates to HCD and CX.
- [**Activities & outputs**](#activities-and-outputs): What we do and how we do it.
- [**Roles**](#roles): Who we are and how we define our roles, skills, and role levels.
- [**Collaboration**](#collaboration): The other practices we work with and our expectations for interaction.
- [**Measure of success**](#measures-of-success): The yardstick. How we might measure and assess our performance.
