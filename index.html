      <p>The purpose of this charter is to define the practice of User Experience (UX) Design, as it exists today at Bixal. The content is based on a number of discussions and workshop sessions over the past year, including the most recent practice area charter activity in June 2020.<br></p>
      <p>The charter contains the following sections:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><a href="#approach-and-mindset"><strong>Approach &amp; mindset</strong></a>: The why. Before we jump into activities and outputs, we set the stage for what the UX Design practice is all about and how it relates to HCD, and CX.</li>

      <h3>The golden circle</h3>
      <p>What is why, how, and what of the UX Design practice?</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Why we do what we do</strong>: We envision a world where everybody who uses the products and services we create or improve gets what they need and enjoys doing it.</li>
        <li><strong>How we do it</strong>: We take a human-centered approach to design. That means we seek to deeply understand the people we’re designing for by talking to them and observing what they do and keeping them at the center of the creation process.</li>
        <li><strong>What we do</strong>: We apply the practices of UX design (including research, interpretation, ideation, prototyping, etc.) alongside our teammates and stakeholders to co-create useful, usable, and delightful experiences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The hierarchy of UX needs</h3>
      <p>This is a slight variation on Aarron Walter’s “hierarchy of needs of users.” When considering what people need, there is a priority, but any solution should include all three components. <br></p>
      <figure style="max-width:331px" id="w-node-a6d2f167e78d-fce711d0" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">

        <figcaption><em>Hierarchy of UX needs</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Useful</strong>: the foundation. We’re creating something to fulfill some purpose. If it’s not meeting a human need, it doesn’t matter how well it works or how nice it looks.</li>
        <li><strong>Usable</strong>: the table stakes. It has to work as expected and be as inclusive as possible for people of varying degrees of experience and abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Delightful</strong>: the icing. We want to help people get things done, but we also want them to enjoy doing it. Even filling out a form can be pleasantly surprising if you put the extra effort into it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The experience design landscape</h3>
      <p>Where does UX fit in among HCD, CX, and Service Design?<br></p>
      <p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-vs-cx/"><em>User Experience vs. Customer Experience: What’s The Difference?</em></a>, Kim Salazar of NN Group discusses scopes of experience at three levels: interaction, journey, and relationship. These roughly map to UX, HCD, and CX.</p>
      <figure style="max-width:2538pxpx" id="w-node-ec815b261557-fce711d0" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
        <div><img src="images/s_8F9BE50C145D8B35FF25F903C4C725D139FB2DE0E71ED2D29D77FF4B2ED098BA_1595595384203_image.png" alt=""></div>
        <figcaption><em>Scopes of experience: different levels of interaction between individuals and organizations</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>Because Service Design incorporates the design of the organization itself (people, processes, and props), and how it supports the overall customer journey, it is present at all levels, but in varying degrees.</p>
      <figure style="max-width:2284pxpx" id="w-node-2bb768986ad8-fce711d0" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
        <div><img src="images/s_8F9BE50C145D8B35FF25F903C4C725D139FB2DE0E71ED2D29D77FF4B2ED098BA_1595595851875_image.png" alt=""></div>
        <figcaption><em>Service Design progressively impacts all levels of experience</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>The UX Design Team primarily operates at the interaction and journey levels. We are usually focused on a particular channel (e.g., a website) or a piece of that channel, but we’re also considering the context of the end-to-end journey of the customer: What did they do before this interaction? What will they do next? And what is their motivation?</p>
      <figure style="max-width:2544pxpx" id="w-node-895948c3b3b1-fce711d0" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">
        <div><img src="images/s_8F9BE50C145D8B35FF25F903C4C725D139FB2DE0E71ED2D29D77FF4B2ED098BA_1595596078118_image.png" alt=""></div>
        <figcaption><em>Our team primarily works at the interaction level while keeping in mind the journey level</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><br></p>
      <h3>Human-centeredness vs. other approaches</h3>
      <p>What does it mean to have a human-centered mindset?<br></p>
      <p>To understand the HCD mindset, it helps to consider the alternatives. If you’re doing organization-driven design, the priorities come from the top down. They typically define the technology constraints and the humans and their needs are an afterthought.</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
        <div><img src="images/s_8F9BE50C145D8B35FF25F903C4C725D139FB2DE0E71ED2D29D77FF4B2ED098BA_1595596847226_image.png" alt=""></div>
        <figcaption><em>Organization-driven design</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>With an HCD approach, you start with the human needs, and you keep them central throughout the process as you factor in organizational priorities and technological constraints. This roughly maps to the IDEO concept of Design Thinking that balances viability, feasibility, and desirability.</p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
        <div><img src="images/s_8F9BE50C145D8B35FF25F903C4C725D139FB2DE0E71ED2D29D77FF4B2ED098BA_1595596994152_image.png" alt=""></div>
        <figcaption><em>Human-centered design</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>Referring back to the levels of experience (interaction, journey, relationship), HCD is less an applied practice than a mindset that must be fostered throughout the whole organization and individual projects. It involves multiple disciplines on the project team (not just designers) and multiple departments within the organization. You can try to do UX Design without an HCD approach (which is a situation we sometimes find ourselves in), but the results are usually less-than-satisfactory.</p>

      <h3>Agile mindset and levels of confidence</h3>
      <p>With an agile mindset, the way we conduct our practice is less about following a prescribed set of steps than <strong><em>working iteratively from a point of more abstraction to a point of more tangibility</em></strong>.<br></p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
        <div><img src="images/s_8F9BE50C145D8B35FF25F903C4C725D139FB2DE0E71ED2D29D77FF4B2ED098BA_1595863115693_image.png" alt=""></div>
        <figcaption><em>Over time, we move from more abstract assumptions and solutions to more tangible ones</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><br></p>
      <p>As our understanding becomes less abstract and more tangible, <strong><em>our level of confidence increases</em></strong>.<br></p>
      <p>In the discovery and research phases, this means talking to clients to better understand the goals of the project and talking to the people we’re designing for to better understand their needs. <br></p>
      <p>In the design and development phases, this means prototyping our hypotheses and validating our assumptions. </p>
      <p><br></p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
        <div><img src="images/s_8F9BE50C145D8B35FF25F903C4C725D139FB2DE0E71ED2D29D77FF4B2ED098BA_1595863582417_image.png" alt=""></div>
        <figcaption><em>As things become more real, from talking to people and building things, we become confident</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As we learn more about the people we’re working with and designing for, our level of confidence about what to do increases. And as we prototype solutions and test them, our level of confidence about whether we’re on the right track increases further.</p>
      <h3>The Playbook</h3>
      <p>The framework we use to communicate and validate this approach is the <a target="_blank" href="https://playbook.cio.gov/">Digital Services Playbook</a> from the U.S. Digital Service. The first three plays constitute a <strong>“definition of done”</strong> for major components of a project.<br></p>
      <ol start="1" role="list">
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play1">Understand what people need</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play2">Address the whole experience, from start to finish</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/#play3" target="_blank">Make it simple and intuitive</a><br></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Do we know who the primary users are? Have we articulated what needs the service will address? If yes, we can proceed with a higher level of confidence. If no, we should do another round of research activities to answer those questions.<br></p>
      <p>Are we using language that is familiar to the primary audience? Are we using language and design consistently throughout the service? If yes, we can proceed with a higher level of confidence. If no, we should do another round of design exploration and test again.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, these questions may already have answers. Not all projects start at the same point or run for the same length of time. And sometimes we&#x27;re not the only team working on a project. By approaching a project with questions instead of list of steps, we can adapt to different situations.</p>
      <h3>The Methods<br></h3>
      <p>We have a collection of activities and tools we call the <a href="https://bixal.github.io/methods/" target="_blank">Bixal Methods</a> that we’ve begun adapting from the original 18F version. Depending on what questions we have at a given point within a project, we choose an appropriate set of methods to conduct within an iteration of research or design.<br></p>
      <figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image">
        <div><img src="images/s_8F9BE50C145D8B35FF25F903C4C725D139FB2DE0E71ED2D29D77FF4B2ED098BA_1595865046058_image.png" alt=""></div>
        <figcaption><em>Questions and methods from a research cycle plan</em></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Instead of mapping the methods to specific “phases” of project, they’re organized by the “goal” at a particular point in the project.</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Awareness</strong>: what is this project all about?</li>
        <li><strong>Observation</strong>: what are people doing today?</li>
        <li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: what did we learn from talking to and observing people?</li>
        <li><strong>Exploration</strong>: what might we do based on what we learned?</li>
        <li><strong>Validation</strong>: are we comfortable moving forward?<br></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each method includes a description of what the activity is, why to use it, and how to conduct it. <strong>This approach gives us a consistent, scalable framework for collaborating on and defining our key activities and deliverables over time as our practice grows and evolves.</strong></p>

      <p>The UX Design Team currently consists of two primary roles: UX Designers and UX Researchers. More detailed information on each role — the related skills and levels — is available in our <a target="_blank" href="https://bixal.github.io/bixal-uxd-team-handbook/capability-framework/about-this-framework.html">Capability Framework</a>.</p>
      <h3>UX Designer</h3>
      <p>UX designers collaborate with the whole team (client + delivery) to create and refine products and services that meet both audience needs and organizational objectives and are enjoyable to use. They consider both the end-to-end flow of the whole experience and individual touchpoints throughout the customer journey.<br></p>
      <p>This role includes the following skills we look for and foster in our teammates:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>Agile mindset</li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>Team collaboration</li>
        <li>Evidence- and context-based design</li>
        <li>Working within constraints</li>
        <li>Leadership and guidance</li>
        <li>Prototyping</li>
        <li>Strategic thinking</li>
        <li>Human-centered</li>
        <li>Inclusive design mindset</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>UX Researcher</h3>
      <p>UX researchers conduct research activities with actual users and communicate findings to help the whole team (client + delivery) develop a deep, shared understanding of the people who use their products and services. This research informs strategy, content, and design to reduce risk and increase the likelihood that implementation will meet audience expectations and achieve organizational objectives.<br></p>
      <p>This role includes the following skills we look for and foster in our teammates:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>Analysis and synthesis</li>
        <li>Inclusive research</li>
        <li>Research skills</li>
        <li>Society and technology</li>
        <li>Strategic insight</li>
        <li>Technical understanding</li>
        <li>Human-centered and agile practices</li>

  <div class="container w-container">
    <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
      <p>In the work we do for clients, we don’t think about it in terms of practices. These are same silos we implore our clients not to create. Nor do we think about in strict, linear phases. This is the same “waterfall” approach we advise our clients not to wade through. Instead, we think about our collaboration in terms of the whole product we’re delivering and who does what at different levels of product zoom.</p>
      <h3>UX Design</h3>
      <p>The UX Design practice is involved at all levels of product zoom. This is what our expectations are of collaboration with each of the practices at each level.</p>
      <h3>Strategy</h3>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Delivery</strong>: understanding scope and constraints, encouraging an agile mindset, providing access to relevant stakeholders, managing client expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Strategy</strong>: understanding the audience and their needs, understanding the domain.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analytics</strong>: understanding the audience and their needs around <em>information accessibility.</em> (What decisions do they need to make? What do they need to know to make those decisions?)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Structure</h3>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Content Strategy</strong>: figuring out how to structure content for audience needs (including information architecture, taxonomy, language usage).</li>
        <li><strong>Development</strong>: understanding the design intent and the technical and business constraints and how we can get to the best solution possible.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Surface</h3>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Visual Design</strong>: ensuring the aesthetic considerations are in harmony with the <em>usable</em> and <em>delightful</em> levels of the UX Hierarchy of Needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Development</strong>: ensuring that design intent and quality is being carried through the interface layer of the product.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Learning</h3>
      <p>The Learning Practice is mentioned separately here because it’s a completely separate “product line,” with its own levels of zoom for each product it delivers. A Learning product also entails strategy, structure, and surface, but the team makeup is slightly different because of the specialized nature of these products. Instead of organizational goals, there are learning objectives. And the Instructional Designers essentially fulfill the role of UX Designer in this context.</p>

    <div class="rich-text-block w-richtext">
      <p>This is not something we currently do in any formalized way. These are two approaches we might implement moving forward, though one is more feasible than the other.</p>
      <h3>The outcomes model</h3>
      <p>If we truly want to measure outcomes, we can return to the conceptual frameworks described above for the UX Hierarchy of Needs at the interaction level and the HCD Mindset at the journey level.<br></p>
      <p>For each level, we could evaluate our solution against the criteria of each level and make a determination about our degree of success on a given project. <strong><em>This would be ideal, but this approach is very difficult, if not impossible, with the way our projects are currently procured, staffed, and delivered.</em></strong><br></p>
      <p>Interaction level:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>Is it useful?</li>
        <li>Is it usable?</li>
        <li>Is it desirable?<br></li>

      <p>Journey level:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li>Is it desirable?</li>
        <li>Is it feasible?</li>
        <li>Is it viable?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The outputs model</h3>
      <p>A more practical approach would be to measure and evaluate our actual activities as a proxy for success, with the idea that assuming we are able to do these types of things, it should result in positive outcomes (though it’s certainly not a guarantee.)<br></p>
      <p>This is only a start, but the criteria could look something like this:</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li><strong>Research planning</strong>: was the research plan appropriate for the project and the initial questions?</li>
        <li><strong>Research iteration</strong>: was there more than 1 round of research completed?</li>
        <li><strong>Research execution</strong>: were we able to complete all the planned activities?</li>
        <li><strong>Findings</strong>: were we able to share findings and get actionable feedback from key stakeholders?</li>
        <li><strong>Design iteration</strong>: did we explore more than one approach?</li>
        <li><strong>Formative testing</strong>: did we test designs in progress and incorporate feedback into subsequent explorations?</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation</strong>: were we able to work with Development on acceptable workarounds that still achieved the design intent?</li>
        <li><strong>Validation</strong>: were we able to get feedback on the live, implemented design?</li>
