# UX Design Practice  Charter

## Hosting
This site was created in Webflow but is now hosted on Github Pages using Jekyll.

## Content
- Content files are in the `_sections` folder in Markdown format.
- Images are marked up using `figure` and included in the content files as includes.
- A few items of "global" content (like site title, meta description, etc.) are in the `globals.yml` data file in the `_data` folder.

## HTML & CSS
- The markup and CSS are mostly carried over from Webflow.

## External Dependencies
- jQuery on Cloudfront
- Typekit for Novel Pro font (same as used on bixal.com)
- Couple things on Cloudflare for IE9 (but who cares about that really?)
